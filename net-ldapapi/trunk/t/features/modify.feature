Feature: Updating attributes of entries within the directory
 As a directory consumer
 I want to ensure that I can adjust attributes on entries within the directory
 In order to extend or update entries with new or updated information

 Background:
   Given a usable Net::LDAPapi class

 Scenario: Can add a new attribute to an entry within the directory
   Given a Net::LDAPapi object that has been connected to the LDAP server
   When I've bound with default authentication to the directory
   And a test container has been created
   And I've added a new entry to the directory
   And I've added a new attribute to the new entry
   Then the new entry result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the added attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the test container has been deleted

 Scenario: Can modify an attribute on an entry within the directory
   Given a Net::LDAPapi object that has been connected to the LDAP server
   When I've bound with default authentication to the directory
   And a test container has been created
   And I've added a new entry to the directory
   And I've added a new attribute to the new entry
   And I've modified the new attribute on the new entry
   Then the new entry result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the added attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the modified attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the test container has been deleted

 Scenario: Can remove an attribute on an entry within the directory
   Given a Net::LDAPapi object that has been connected to the LDAP server
   When I've bound with default authentication to the directory
   And a test container has been created
   And I've added a new entry to the directory
   And I've added a new attribute to the new entry
   And I've removed the new attribute from the new entry
   Then the new entry result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the added attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the removed attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the test container has been deleted

 Scenario: Can asynchronously add a new attribute to an entry within the directory
   Given a Net::LDAPapi object that has been connected to the LDAP server
   When I've asynchronously bound with default authentication to the directory
   And a test container has been created
   And I've asynchronously added a new entry to the directory
   And I've asynchronously added a new attribute to the new entry
   Then after waiting for all results, the new entry result message type is LDAP_RES_ADD
   And the new entry result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And after waiting for all results, the added attribute result message type is LDAP_RES_MODIFY
   And the added attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the test container has been deleted

   And after waiting for all results, the added attribute result message type is LDAP_RES_MODIFY
   And the added attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And after waiting for all results, the modified attribute result message type is LDAP_RES_MODIFY
   And the removed attribute result is LDAP_SUCCESS
   And the test container has been deleted
